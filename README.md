# Optimization-and-Algorithms

This repository contains the code of the project developed for the Optimization and Algorithms course in the Master's program for Electrical and Computer Engineering (2020/21).

The project is divided in **3 parts**, each part has its respective tasks.

## Part 1

- **Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4**: Transferring a robot (_l<sub>1</sub>_, _l<sub>2</sub>_, and _l<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>_ regularizers);
- **Tasks 5, 6**: Locating a moving target (Distance from a critical point, and smallest enclosing rectangle).

## Part 2

- **Task 1**: Logistic Regression (Mathematical proof);
- **Tasks 2, 3, 4**: Gradient Method;
- **Tasks 5, 6, 7**: Newton Method.

## Part 3

- **Task 1**: Dimensionality reduction with Multidimensional Scaling;
- **Tasks 2, 3, 4**: Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method.
